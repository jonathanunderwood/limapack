LIMAPACK - calculating molecular axis alignment in laser fields
================================================================

LIMAPACK is a software package for calculating the molecular axis
alignment resulting from exposing molecules to intense non-resonant
laser fields. LIMAPACK is an evolution of code written over several
years by Jonathan Underwood. The present focus is on making the code
available in a modular form such that it becomes a platform for
collaborative development by interested parties. As such this involves
a large cleanup and re-factoring effort. Once this phase is complete,
new features will be added.

Current features include:

o Can optionally use MPI for running on large clusters
o Uses pthreads for multi-threading on a single machine with multiple 
  CPU cores
o Able to treat linear, symmetric top, and asymmetric top molecules
o Able to treat arbitrary laser fields

Installation
=============
Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file included
with the software.
