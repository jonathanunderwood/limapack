o Use proper data hiding in many modules eg. polarizability.c, j(k)marray.c etc

o Convert all macros for converting to/from atomic units to inline functions

o Run indent over all files to clean up formatting

o Sort out what functions would be usefully exported and build a
  shared library and Python bindings.

o Perhaps the MPI/pthreads handling and job control should all be done
  at the Python layer such that the C library is simplified.

o Be more careful about checking that populations aren't starting to
  overflow the upper states. For example, in the asymrot case we check
  the population levels in the Jmax and Jmax-1 manifolds, but in the
  field it may be that lower J levels are higher in energy - the n
  dependence is not clear. See asymrot_molecule_check_populations function.

o Presently there's no locking around the functions which get tdse
  jobs, and set tdse jobs as done. This could be a problem if more
  than a single process is marshalling jobs. Add a mutex around the
  related structures.
